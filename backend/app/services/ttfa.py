"""TTFA — Time to First Agent, per registered account, within one workspace.

The clock starts at the account's first successful login (`User.first_login_at`,
falling back to `created_at` for accounts that logged in before the column
existed) and stops at the end of the earliest **succeeded** `Deployment` of an
`Agent` in this workspace whose `owner` is that account. `Agent.owner` is the
creating identity's username, stamped server-side by the create/convert routes and
by the assistant approval path; it is matched case-insensitively against
`User.username_key`. Agents deleted since still count — TTFA is a historical fact.

The built-in admin has no `users` row and is never a sample. Pending accounts
(no session possible yet) are excluded; every other account that can reach the
workspace (admins, members granted it, or anyone who owns an agent in it) is
listed, with `ttfa_seconds = None` until they ship their first agent.
