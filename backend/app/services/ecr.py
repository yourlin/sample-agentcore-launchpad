"""ECR digest resolution and the scan gate for the container deploy path (T10).

Two jobs, both about knowing exactly what is being deployed:

* **digest resolution** — the container path tags images `{agent}-v{version}`, a
  mutable tag. Deploying by tag means what a runtime executes can change under it
  without any record. `resolve_digest` turns the tag into the immutable
  `sha256:…` that `CreateAgentRuntime` is given instead.
* **the scan gate** — ECR scans on push (see `infra/stacks/base_stack.py`); this
  reads the result and lets the caller refuse to deploy a vulnerable image.

The client is passed in, not built here: ECR is not an AgentCore service, so it
does not belong behind `services/agentcore/client.py`, and the deployer already
constructs its own `s3`/`codebuild` clients the same way. Injection is what makes
these testable against a stub.
