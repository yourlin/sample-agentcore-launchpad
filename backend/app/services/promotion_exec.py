"""Promotion execution: an approved release, actually delivered (roadmap T27).

An approved `Promotion` becomes a background **job** (`jobs.type = promotion_execute`)
running against the TARGET workspace, with the same operational shape as a deploy: a `Job`
row whose JSONL log carries every stage, per-stage status persisted (here on the promotion
itself, because the console renders one card per stage), and a startup resume that
re-enters at the first stage that did not finish.

Stages, in order:

    resolve → copy → provision → deploy → smoke → canary → observe → complete

* **resolve** rewrites the frozen spec for the target through the logical resource mapping
  (T23) and refuses to continue while a reference has no mapping there.
* **copy** moves the stored artifact into the target account (T24). Skipped, with the
  reason logged, for a bundle that has none (a harness, or a zip built from the spec).
* **provision** stakes the target agent's ledger row and queues an ordinary deploy job for
  it. The per-agent IAM role is created by that deploy's own `provision` stage.
* **deploy** runs that deploy (create, or an in-place update that publishes a new version
  and keeps the prior spec in history) and waits for it. When the target already runs the
  agent and can host a runtime canary, *this stage instead mints the candidate version and
  stands up the canary gateway* — the champion must survive to be compared against, so the
  new spec cannot be published over it first.
* **smoke** sends a handful of fixed prompts to the target and stops the run if any fails.
* **canary** drives the existing runtime canary through 90/10 → 50/50 → 1/99, one traffic
  round and one verdict per weight. Skipped, with the reason logged, when there is no
  running agent to compare against or the agent cannot host a canary.
* **observe** holds at full traffic for the policy's observation window, then probes again.
* **complete** promotes the candidate (canary path) and cleans the canary up.

`rollback` runs the same stages against the *previous* bundle, with canary/observe skipped:
it re-publishes the earlier spec as a new version through the normal deploy path — it is
never an AWS-side revert.

Everything that touches AWS is reached through a seam a test can replace: the inner deploy
runs through `deployer.pipeline` (whose stage functions tests stub), the canary through
`CANARY`, invocation through `_invoke`, the artifact copy through `artifact_copy.copy_artifact`.
