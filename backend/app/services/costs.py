"""Spend attribution in dollars (roadmap T28).

The Observability console already estimates cost per model and per session
(`observability.estimate_cost`, priced from the `model_prices` map). What it could not
answer is the question an administrator actually asks: **who spent it** — which agent,
which person, how much of this month's budget is left.

Two dimensions, each derived from data the platform already has rather than a new
telemetry path:

* **by agent** — spans carry the runtime's service name, so one Logs Insights query
  grouped by service gives per-agent tokens, which the shared price map turns into
  dollars. A service name that matches no ledger agent is still reported (an imported or
  deleted agent spent real money).
* **by person** — spans do not carry a console identity, so attribution goes through the
  ledger: per-session tokens joined to `ChatSession.actor_id`. Sessions the console did
  not open (direct `/v1` traffic, evaluation runs) land under a single `—` bucket rather
  than being silently dropped, because an unattributed total that looks like zero is
  worse than one that says "unattributed".

Every figure is an **estimate** and says so: prices are a config map matched by
substring, a model missing from it contributes tokens but no dollars, and the response
names those models so the number is never quietly wrong.
