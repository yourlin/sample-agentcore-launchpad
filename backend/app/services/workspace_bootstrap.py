"""Workspace bootstrap as a resumable job.

`make bootstrap` provisions the hub with CDK plus a linear boto3 pass. A
workspace registered from the console lives in a region where no stack is
deployed and nobody can run `cdk deploy` from a web backend, so the same
substrate is provisioned here with boto3 only, as a staged job:

    validate-access → iam → storage → codebuild → cognito
    → gateway → memory → registry → skill-lab → observability → finalize

The shape follows `deployer/pipeline.py` on purpose — ordered stages, per-stage
status persisted (here on `Job.payload["stages"]`, the same records the deploy
pipeline keeps on `Deployment.stages`), JSONL events on `Job.log`, and a resume
that skips whatever already succeeded. Every stage is idempotent (list-or-get
then create, the `ensure_*` contract from `bootstrap.py`) and **records the
identifiers it produced on the workspace row as it goes**, so a resumed run sees
the previous run's outputs instead of re-deriving them.

What this deliberately does not provision, and why:

* **policy engine** — operator-managed through Governance since the bootstrap
  flow made it opt-in (`d071afa`); governance reads the live gateway attachment.
* **KB gateway** — created lazily on first managed-KB use (`kb_gateway.py`).
* **the demo Build-Tools layer** (hr-database Lambda, office-facts REST API) —
  CDK-shipped sample *code*, so a workspace's gateway simply has no demo targets.
* **demo Cognito users** — a workspace is an operator environment, not a lab.

The job is credential-agnostic: it runs with the hub's own credentials for a
workspace in this account and through an assumed spoke role for one in another,
and the only stage that knows the difference is `validate-access`, which reports
a role that cannot be assumed. Everything else goes through
`ctx.workspace.client(...)`, and the context is the one thing that knows where
those clients point.
