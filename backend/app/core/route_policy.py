"""Console authorization: one declarative table for every `/api` route.

Why a table instead of per-route `Depends(require_admin)`:

* a reviewer can audit the whole authorization posture in one file rather than by
  grepping 19 routers;
* it is **default-deny** — a route with no entry raises instead of silently
  serving, so a newly added endpoint cannot ship unclassified. `tests/
  test_route_policy.py` enumerates the live routes and fails on drift in both
  directions.

Roles: `ADMIN` requires an administrator identity; `MEMBER` requires only a live
session (the `auth_middleware` 401 already covers that); `PUBLIC` is reachable
without one (health, docs, and the login surface itself). A `perm:<key>` value
requires that member permission (admins implicitly hold all; a member holds every
key unless an admin stored an explicit denial on their account — see
`auth.AGENT_PERMISSIONS` and the Users console).

The classification principle, signed off by river 2026-08-03: **admin for routes
that execute code, change deployed or cloud state, mint credentials, or change
governance posture; member for reads and for the member's own interaction with an
agent.** Amended by river 2026-08-07: the agent-lifecycle routes (deploy,
discovery import, delete, convert and the deploy-flow skill helpers) are
member-grantable via `perm:agents.*`, **default granted**, revocable per user.
Amended by river 2026-08-10: starting evaluation/insights runs
(`POST /api/eval/runs`) is member-grantable via `perm:eval.run` on the same
default-granted terms — it invokes agents (member parity with Chat) and creates
billable AWS eval jobs, which revocation can still shut off per user.
Amended by river 2026-08-11: **the whole console is member-reachable except user
management** — every route that used to demand `ADMIN` (registry writes, knowledge
bases, governance, evaluation datasets/evaluators, experiments, canaries, API keys,
studio local exec, tools/demos, prices refresh) is now `MEMBER`; only `/api/users*`
still requires an administrator. The `perm:*` entries keep their revocation
semantics unchanged.
Amended 2026-10-04 (issue #55): creating, editing and deleting AgentCore Memory
resources (`/api/memory/resources` writes) is member-grantable via
`perm:memory.manage` on the same default-granted, revocable terms — DeleteMemory
is irreversible — and those routes reach only memories the workspace manages.
Adopting an existing account memory into management is `ADMIN`.
Since 2026-08-12 the table carries a **second dimension**: whether a route
operates inside a workspace (one account/region environment). `WORKSPACE_EXEMPT`
names the hub-global routes; every other entry is workspace-scoped, and
`enforce_route_policy` resolves + authorizes the caller's workspace for it
before the handler runs (`routers/workspaces.resolve_workspace`). Absence from
the exempt set *is* the classification, so a new route cannot ship without one.

Consequences worth knowing before editing this table:

* Data is partitioned per workspace, not per user: within a workspace every
  member still sees and can mutate the same shared agents, records, datasets and
  gateways, but a member only reaches the workspaces an admin granted them
  (`user_workspaces`), and a resource id belonging to another workspace answers
  404. `ADMIN` marks user/workspace management, announcement publication and
  the gateway's consent portal (it passes an operator-named IAM role);
  it does not generically mark "state changes".
* The studio local-exec surface (`/api/execute*`, conversations writes) stays safe
  in production through its own handler guard (`local_exec`, refused outright in
  prod unless explicitly opted in) — that guard, not this table, is the real
  boundary there.
* Invoking an agent is deliberately `MEMBER` (`/api/agents/{id}/invoke`,
  `/api/registry/a2a-demo`): it is the same capability the Chat console gives
  every member, so gating it while Chat stays open would protect nothing.

* The account-free `/share/*` routes (T13) sit outside `/api` — no console session,
  no `X-Workspace` — and are classified here as `PUBLIC` + hub-global so the drift
  test covers them; `enforce_route_policy` itself only runs for `/api`.

There is deliberately **no** setting that disables this table. A flag that turns
authorization off is the vulnerability; fixing a misclassification means editing
the entry.
