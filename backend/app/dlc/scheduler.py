"""The one background tick (§10): scheduled re-evaluation, alerts and expiry sweeps.

Launchpad had exactly one periodic thread (the model-price refresher); everything else
only happened when a request asked for it, which is why alert rules were evaluated by
whoever opened the page and a model could be updated under an agent unnoticed.

This adds a single 60-second tick that:

* runs `watch_configs` that are due (respecting their cost ceiling);
* evaluates alert rules and notifies only on a transition;
* sweeps calibration and waiver expiry into inbox-visible state.

Single-writer safety: every task claims a `scheduler_claims` row with a conditional
UPDATE, so a second backend process cannot double-run it; a claim older than ten minutes
is reclaimable (a crashed process must not wedge the schedule). Nothing here raises: a
failing task records its error and the tick continues.
