"""Workspaces: the environment a request operates in, and their administration.

Two things live here, the way `routers/auth.py` owns both the login surface and
`require_identity`:

* **the request boundary** — `resolve_workspace` runs for every workspace-scoped
  route (from `enforce_route_policy`, so a handler cannot forget it), authorizes
  the caller against the workspace, and caches the result on
  `request.state.workspace`; handlers read it back with `require_workspace`;
* **the admin CRUD surface** — register / rename / detach (or purge) a workspace,
  and read or edit its grants. Grants have two shapes for two consoles: the
  per-user full replacement `PATCH /api/users/{id}` (`UserPatch.workspaces`) and
  the workspace-side bulk `PUT /api/workspaces/{id}/grants` here. Both write
  nothing but `user_workspaces`, so there is still one source of truth (see
  `replace_grants` for why the second shape is not a convenience).

A workspace in another account carries the `role_arn` the hub assumes and the
`external_id` the spoke's trust policy requires; both are validated here, and the
bootstrap job's `validate-access` stage is what proves they actually work.
