"""Runtime zip fast path (Strands / Studio agents).

    generate  → render the Strands template from the AgentSpec
    package   → pip install (ARM64 wheels) → zip → S3 artifacts bucket
    provision → reuse the shared execution role
    deploy    → CreateAgentRuntime + poll READY (5–15 min tolerated)

Package/deploy internals adapted from agentcore_eva_opt backend/app/deployer.py
