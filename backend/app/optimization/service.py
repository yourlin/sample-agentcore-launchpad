"""Optimization loop orchestration (adapted from agentcore_eva_opt
routers/abtest.py + recommend.py + bundles.py — github.com/xiehust/agentcore_eva_opt).

Stepwise actions, each user-triggered (stage = furthest point completed):
    recommend → accept → bundles → gateway → abtest → traffic → verdict
    → promote → cleanup
Long actions run on a daemon thread via run_action, streaming a progress
line onto the experiment row (running_action/progress) so the UI can poll
and a reload resumes mid-action. Short actions run inline in the request.

The experiment gateway is separate from launchpad-gw: AWS_IAM auth, no
protocolType, targets of type http→agentcoreRuntime so A/B routing happens
at {gatewayUrl}/{target}/invocations.

    ``path_suffix`` / ``body_for`` default to the Runtime target contract
    (``/<target>/invocations`` + ``{prompt, sessionId}``); a Harness canary's
    passthrough targets take ``/<target>`` and the InvokeHarness body instead.

    Prompts go out **concurrently**, at most ``TRAFFIC_MAX_CONCURRENCY`` in
    flight, because each prompt is an independent session: its ``uuid4`` session
    id is pinned into the sticky runtime-session header, so one prompt is one
    session is one arm and the 50/50 split happens *across* prompts. Nothing is
    shared between two sends, so the only thing concurrency changes is how long
    the stage takes (``ceil(N / workers)`` round trips instead of ``N``).

    Three properties the callers depend on:

    * ``progress`` is only ever called on **this** thread. It ends in a ledger
      write (``_update``), and ten worker threads writing the same SQLite row
      would contend for the writer lock; the workers therefore do HTTP and
      nothing else, while completions are consumed here.
    * ``session_ids`` is ordered by **input prompt order**, not completion order
      — the ids are minted before submission — so replaying one dataset twice
      yields comparable artifacts.
    * An *exception* (expired credentials, DNS, a request slower than
      ``TRAFFIC_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_S``) still propagates and fails the stage, as it
      did when this loop was serial: a fatal error must not be laundered into
      the ``failed`` count — note that this makes one too-slow prompt fail the
      whole send rather than costing one sample. The workers
      stop picking up new prompts as soon as one of them fails, so a bad
      credential does not fire N more doomed requests; requests already in
      flight finish and are joined first. Which error surfaces is decided by
      input order, not by which failure came back first.

    Every prompt carries the runtime user id header (``user_id``): the Gateway passes
    it on as ``runtimeUserId``, which is what gives the runtime a workload access
    token — without it an agent whose tools need an outbound Identity token (a
    converted twin's Gateway MCP client) errors on every session and the A/B test
    never gets a score.

    Non-200 responses keep counting into ``failed`` (the stage still succeeds).
    ``status_counts`` breaks those down by status code so a throttled run
    (``{"200": 47, "429": 3}``) is distinguishable from an agent error — keys are
    strings because the artifact round-trips through a JSON column, which would
    stringify int keys anyway.
