"""Unicorn Air fee and baggage rules as two tools.

This module is the point of the sample: **it does not change** when the agent
moves from LangChain to Strands. Only the decorator import at the bottom of the
file differs, and the two framework entrypoints import from here, so the
business logic is written once.

Every number comes from the workshop's policy sheet (`samples/kb_docs`,
rules `A-02`…`A-15`); all of it is fictional. Keep the worked example in
`refund_quote` matching rule `A-07`: Standard, fare 1200, 72 h before
departure -> fee 300, taxes 80, refund 980.
