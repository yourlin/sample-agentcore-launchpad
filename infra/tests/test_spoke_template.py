"""The spoke role template (`infra/spoke/launchpad-workspace-role.yaml`).

It is plain CloudFormation, deployed by an Organization admin into another
account, so nothing else in `make verify` reads it at all. This suite parses the
file rather than pattern-matching it, by handing it to CDK's own template loader
(`CfnInclude`), which is the same parser `cdk deploy` uses. No YAML dependency is
added: aws-cdk-lib brings the parser.

What that parse actually catches (measured, not assumed): malformed YAML, and an
intrinsic referencing something the template does not declare (`Ref` to a missing
parameter). What it does NOT catch: an unknown resource *property*, and — the one
worth stating out loud — a **misspelled action name**. IAM itself accepts
`s3:PutObjct` and simply never matches it, so no offline check can flag it; only
the live bootstrap can, by denying the call that needed it.

The assertions therefore aim at the properties that make the template *safe*
rather than merely valid: the trust policy's exactly-two conditions, PassRole's
PassedToService condition, and the ARN scoping of the statements that can be
scoped (a `Resource: "*"` sneaking into one of those is the regression this
catches). They read the parsed template by key, which is also what turns a typo
in one of those property names into a failure here.
